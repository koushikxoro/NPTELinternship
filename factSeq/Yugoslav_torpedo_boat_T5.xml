The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by an [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbine driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82 F''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by an [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbine driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82 F''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-[[submarine]] operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During World War I, ''87 F'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-[[submarine]] operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица).

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast.

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May&amp;nbsp;–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

==Career==

===World War I===

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May{{spaced ndash}}June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]].

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours.

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). In KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]].

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast.

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} Sixteen F-group boats were completed between October 1913 and December 1916, designated ''82''&amp;nbsp;– ''97 F''. ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' (later designated ''T5'') was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast.

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic.

She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F''and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F''and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} {{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions. {{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}}

In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}} On 10 June 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} from the Italian [[MAS boat]]s that sank her.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''78 T'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]]. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''78 T'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[scout cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[scout cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[scout cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[scout cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the scout cruiser {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the [[scout cruiser]] {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the Ganz &amp; Danubius boats were classified as sea-going. The 250t-class were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally built as '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the vessel was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was broken up in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–15, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]] reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] [[Škoda 7 cm guns|{{convert|66|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''.

The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] [[Škoda 7 cm guns|{{convert|66|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''. At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force.

During the [[interwar period]], ''T7'' and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] [[Škoda 7 cm guns|{{convert|66|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/40 anti-aircraft guns,{{sfn|Brescia|2012|p=151}} but no other significant alterations was made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}} After the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}  ''T5'' was commissioned by the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after the war,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and renamed ''Cer''. She was fitted with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and one {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.{{sfn|Gardiner|1983|p=388}}

The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T5''''' was a sea-going [[torpedo boat]] that was operated by the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] between 1921 and 1941. Originally '''''87 F''''', a [[250t-class torpedo boat]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] built in 1914–1915, she was armed with two {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]] and [[shore bombardment]] missions. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''87 F'' was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T5''. At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force.

During the [[interwar period]], ''T7'' and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as ''T5''. At the end of the war she was transferred to the new [[Yugoslav Navy]] and served as '''''Cer''''' until she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1962.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|t|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at the [[Bay of Kotor|Bocche di Cattaro]] (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, because [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, [[Ganz Works|Ganz &amp; Danubius]], reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz &amp; Danubius' main shipyard at [[Rijeka|Fiume]].{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] F-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.5|m|ftin}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|266|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|330|t|LT|0}} fully loaded.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The boats were powered by two [[AEG]]-Curtiss steam turbines driving two [[propeller]]s, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbines were rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|abbr=on}} and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of {{convert|28|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} They carried {{convert|20|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of coal and {{convert|34|t|LT|sigfig=3}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|1200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The F-group had two [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]s rather than the single funnel of the T-group.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} Due to inadequate funding, ''87 F'' and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}} They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were armed with two [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] [[Škoda 7 cm guns|{{convert|66|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} They could also carry 10–12 [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 5 March 1914, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=60}}

==Career==

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''87 F'' was used for [[convoy]], patrol, escort and [[minesweeping]] tasks, [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine operations]],{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and [[shore bombardment]] missions.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} On 3 February 1916, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against [[Ortona]] and [[San Vito Chietino]], led by the [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}.{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=169}} Three days later, the [[scout cruiser]] {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|2}}, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser {{HMS|Weymouth|1910|6}} and French [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Bouclier||2}} north of [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser {{ship|SMS|Novara|1913|2}} led a force which included ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two {{sclass-|Kaiman|torpedo boat|2}}s in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two [[Naval drifter|drifters]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=170}} On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of [[Sant'Elpidio a Mare]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2015|p=171}} In 1917, one of her 66&amp;nbsp;mm guns was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of [[Port of Ravenna|Porto Corsini]], [[Marotta (village)|Marotta]] and [[Cesenatico]].{{sfn|Cernuschi|O'Hara|2016|p=68}}

By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Miklós Horthy]], decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133–134}} During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the [[dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}. At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the [[Boom (navigational barrier)|harbour defence barrage]] opened, the dreadnoughts {{ship|SMS|Szent István||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''87&amp;nbsp;F'', also departed Pola and set course for [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent István'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, two [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}} Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit ''Szent István''. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on ''Szent István'' were abreast her [[Fire room|boiler rooms]], which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent István'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} In October 1918, ''87&amp;nbsp;F'' was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.{{sfn|Halpern|2012|pp=259–261}}

===Interwar period===
''87 F'' survived the war intact.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] by which [[Republic of German-Austria|rump Austria]] officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, ''93 F'', ''96 F'' and ''97 F'', and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921,{{sfn|Vego|1982|p=345}} in KJRM service, ''87 F'' was renamed ''T5''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=733}} In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser ''[[SMS Niobe|Dalmacija]]'', the [[submarine tender]] ''Hvar'' and the submarines {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Hrabri||2}} and {{ship|Yugoslav submarine|Nebojša||2}}, on a cruise to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], the Greek island of [[Corfu]] in the Ionian Sea, and [[Bizerte]] in the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]]. It is not clear if ''T5'' was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=183}} In 1932, the British naval [[attaché]] reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=451}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T5'' was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at [[Šibenik]], which included her three former F-group sisters.{{sfn|Niehorster|2016}} On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of [[Zadar|Zara]] on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of [[Zaton, Zadar County|Zaton]] into [[Lake Prokljan]], where they remained until 11 April.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=333}} On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at [[Milna]] on the island of [[Brač]], and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.{{sfn|Terzić|1982|p=404}} All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=58 &amp; 60}}

''T5'' was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic.
